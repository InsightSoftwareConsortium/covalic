This is the repository for the COVALIC (Comparison and Validation for Image Computing) project.

COVALIC provides ITK-based C++ plugins for comparing different image processing algorithms that was
used in multiple public challenges as a backend server code. These plugins are ITK filter classes that
are wrapped in a generic command line interface described by XML files to facilitate batch processing
in a variety of systems.

COVALIC is currently in use at the following sites:
