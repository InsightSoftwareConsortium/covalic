/**
 * covalicMacro.h defines standard system-wide macros, constants, and other
 * parameters. One of its most important functions is to define macros used
 * to interface to instance variables in a standard fashion. For example,
 * these macros manage modified time, debugging information, and provide a
 * standard interface to set and get instance variables.  Macros are
 * available for built-in types; for string classe; vector arrays;
 * object pointers; and debug, warning, and error printout information.
